Here's a doc I wrote explaining the details of the algorithm + why I built it :)

A list of the resources I used to build this: 

CGCNN: https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn/blob/master/pre-trained/bulk-moduli.pth.tar
Materials Project: https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/ 
CDVAE: https://github.com/txie-93/cdvae
MODNet: https://github.com/ppdebreuck/modnet


btw - to run this, you'll probably need to set up a venv.
